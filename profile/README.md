ðŸ‘‹ Hello! We've been working on moving our infrastructure off of Big Tech this year (2025). As part of that process, we've switched to using a self-hosted [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/products/gitea/) instance as our Git forge. So far, it's working out really well! [The docs are here](https://docs.gitea.com/category/installation) if you want to give it a try.

We'll probably continue to mirror our public code here, and we'll leave our old projects up as an archive, but we hope to spend much less time on this website going forward. If you need to get in touch, send an email to team@fightforthefuture.org.
